  "The Eiffel Tower can grow over 6 inches taller in the summer due to heat expansion. This happens because the metal expands in the heat and contracts in the cold. Engineers account for this seasonal change in its design.",
  "Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood, thanks to a copper-rich protein called hemocyanin. Two of the hearts pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Interestingly, the heart that serves the body stops beating when the octopus swims.",
  "Bananas are classified as berries, but strawberries are not. This is due to the botanical definitions that depend on how the fruit develops. True berries come from one flower with one ovary and typically contain several seeds.",
  "The human nose can detect over 1 trillion different scents. This sensory ability surpasses what scientists used to believe just a few decades ago. The olfactory system is incredibly sensitive and complex.",
  "Sharks have existed for over 400 million years, predating trees by about 50 million years. They’ve survived multiple mass extinction events. Their resilience makes them one of the oldest surviving vertebrate species.",
  "A group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance', which suits their colorful appearance and social nature. They often gather in large colonies for protection and mating. Their pink color comes from carotenoid pigments in their food.",
  "The average cumulus cloud weighs over 1.1 million pounds, yet it floats effortlessly in the sky. This is possible because the weight is spread out over a vast area. The water droplets are also small and spaced apart.",
  "Mozart composed his first symphony when he was just 8 years old. He showed exceptional musical talent as a child, performing across Europe. His early works were guided by his father, Leopold, who was also a musician.",
  "Sloths can hold their breath for up to 40 minutes, which is longer than dolphins. They slow their heart rate dramatically to conserve oxygen. This is especially useful when they dive into water.",
  "There’s a species of jellyfish called *Turritopsis dohrnii* that can essentially live forever. When faced with injury or old age, it can revert to an earlier life stage. This process can, in theory, repeat indefinitely.",
